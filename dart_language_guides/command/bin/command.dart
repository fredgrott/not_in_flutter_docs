// In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral
// design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information
// needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
// This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method
// and values for the method parameters.
//
// Four terms always associated with the command pattern are command, receiver,
// invoker and client.
//
// A command object knows about receiver and invokes a method of the receiver.
// Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command.
//
// The receiver object to execute these methods is also stored in the
// command object by aggregation. The receiver then does the work when the
// execute() method in command is called.
//
// An invoker object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does
// bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything
// about a concrete command, it knows only about the command interface.
//
// Invoker object(s), command objects and receiver objects are held by a
// client object, the client decides which receiver objects it assigns to
// the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the invoker.
// The client decides which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command,
// it passes the command object to the invoker object.
//
// Using command objects makes it easier to construct general components that
// need to delegate, sequence or execute method calls at a time of their choosing
// without the need to know the class of the method or the method parameters.
// Using an invoker object allows bookkeeping about command executions to be
// conveniently performed, as well as implementing different modes for commands,
// which are managed by the invoker object, without the need for the client to
// be aware of the existence of bookkeeping or modes.
