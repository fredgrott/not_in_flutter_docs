// In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy
// pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting
// an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly,
// code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.
//
// Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
// Strategy is one of the patterns included in the influential book Design
// Patterns by Gamma et al. that popularized the concept of using design patterns
// to describe how to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software.
// Deferring the decision about which algorithm to use until runtime allows
// the calling code to be more flexible and reusable.
//
// For instance, a class that performs validation on incoming data may use the
// strategy pattern to select a validation algorithm depending on the type of data,
// the source of the data, user choice, or other discriminating factors. These
// factors are not known until run-time and may require radically different validation
// to be performed. The validation algorithms (strategies), encapsulated separately
// from the validating object, may be used by other validating objects in different
// areas of the system (or even different systems) without code duplication.
//
// Typically the strategy pattern stores a reference to some code in a data
// structure and retrieves it. This can be achieved by mechanisms such as the
// native function pointer, the first-class function, classes or class instances
// in object-oriented programming languages, or accessing the language implementation's
// internal storage of code via reflection.
