// The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is
// meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two
// can vary independently", introduced by the Gang of Four. The bridge uses
// encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities
// into different classes.
//
// When a class varies often, the features of object-oriented programming
// become very useful because changes to a program's code can be made easily
// with minimal prior knowledge about the program. The bridge pattern is useful
// when both the class and what it does vary often. The class itself can be
// thought of as the abstraction and what the class can do as the implementation.
// The bridge pattern can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.
//
// When there is only one fixed implementation, this pattern is known as the
// Pimpl idiom in the C++ world.
//
// The bridge pattern is often confused with the adapter pattern, and is often
// implemented using the object adapter pattern, e.g. in the Java code below.
//
// Variant: The implementation can be decoupled even more by deferring the
// presence of the implementation to the point where the abstraction is utilized.
