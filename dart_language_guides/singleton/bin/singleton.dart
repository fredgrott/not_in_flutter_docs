// In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern
// that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is
// useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
// The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
//
//* The abstract factory, builder, and prototype patterns can use singletons in their implementation.
//* Facade objects are often singletons because only one facade object is required.
//* State objects are often singletons.
//
// Singletons are often preferred to global variables because:
// * They do not pollute the global namespace (or, in languages with nested namespaces,
// their containing namespace) with unnecessary variables.[4]
// * They permit lazy allocation and initialization, whereas global variables in
// many languages will always consume resources.
