# Skeleton Best Practices

![best practice](./media/best-practice.png)


I am transforming the Flutter Skeleton App Template app to 
one that has some damn Best Practices in it. The only thing 
missing is how to implement state management and dependency injection.

## Steps To Best Practices

You can follow the steps

0 [app without changes](./skeleton_zero)
App without any best practices improvements.

1 [skeleton error screen](./skeleton_errorscreen)
A Branded error screen has been added.

2 [skeleton sliverappbar]
Added sliverappbar for a more branded appbar approach to integrate with adaptive navigation pattern.

3 [skeleton widget view]
Added widget view pattern to separate out presenting from the layout layers in the UI layer.
